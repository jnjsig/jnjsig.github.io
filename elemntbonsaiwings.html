      <h1>The Story How It Happened</h1>
      <p class='story'>Once upon a time, there was a little boy named Nathan, small in stature but full of big dreams. One day, while playing near a staircase, he started jumping down the steps. Suddenly, something extraordinary happened—he pushed his brain beyond its limits, and in a glitch of reality, he propelled himself with sheer thought. Believe it or not, he flew for a few seconds. (AIR)</p>
      <p class='story'>The house where Nathan lived had an old shed that had never been opened since his family had just moved in. One day, when his parents weren’t paying attention, he ventured inside and discovered an old double-barrel shotgun with a wooden stock. (FIRE)</p>
      <p class='story'>As Nathan grew older, he began experimenting with technology, attempting to create a suck website network.(WATER)</p>
      <p class='story'>Nathan was lucky. One night, a star fell near his home. The next morning, he went searching for it, and to his amazement, he found the meteorite. Cracking it open, he discovered a rainbow-colored stone. (EARTH)</p>
      <p class='story'>Nathan grew up, and though many remarkable things happened to him, those stories are for another time. He pursued music, becoming quite talented. After years of making music, he eventually started singing. One day, while hiking up a mountain, recording as he walked, Nathan suddenly remembered the meteorite from his childhood. As the sun was setting, he somehow summoned it above his head. In that moment, he recalled the feeling of flying as a boy. The meteorite shimmered, revealing wings of light. He thought of the gun, and a fiery tornado began to swirl around the meteorite, drawing closer to him.</p>
      <p class='story'>Nathan looked down, sucked the meteorite into himself, then glanced up to see a small green bonsai tree appearing beside him. He pulled out his phone and began recording his song, noticing that the bonsai was following him. He made a song about that very moment, where the little tree trailed after him.
      <p class='story'>And that’s how the story ends.</p>
